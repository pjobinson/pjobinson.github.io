**dark forest**

I was wandering with a spear, looking for a prey

I reached a riverside and looked into the water waves

I found myself as a prey.

**dark stomach**

I was sitting inside the stomach of a huge whale;

I was eaten by the whale long before;and still wasn’t digested;

**dark night**

It was a sleepless night; i was tired and tied up to something..

I stared up and down.. found  darkness….

**darkness…**

It means something which is very dark and darkest….

Really am not seeing any  ray of light anywhere….

well now i know …. i was blind…

In the end;
